# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Launch Pad LLC is prepared to launch on November 15th for pre-sale of 20,000 Helium Hotspot LoRaWAN Gateways. As an altertive to the current RAK hotspots. These are more compact than previously offered models, and extremely attractive. They will be more appealing and make it easier for acquiring host locations. These devices come equipped with hardware key and GPS. We will also provide a dashboard, and custom image for them making it easier to be managed remotely; thus making it so one doesn’t have to be right next to the devices to diagnose or reboot etc. 

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

It solves the problem of Helium hotspot currently unavailable for purchase. "This item is currently out of stock" sends the wrong message. It screams that Helium is not ready for growth. Also having several trusted vendors is a good thing. The Helium website reads like this: "Hotspots are built by a variety of vendors." So far this is not true. Launch Pad can help make this happen. 
The expected outcome of having more vendors, is the ability to grow the Helium network which creates exactly what Helium needs to create, momentum and bringing people together to form a new global network and undertake the "Proof-of-Coverage".


# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

Helium enthusiast and early adopters who are anxious to be a part of creating the network and being a part of the history of Helium will be positively affected, because they will now be able to purchase gateways.  

The delay of gateways for purchase will impede the current momentum and the dream that Helium has cast for the 'The People’s Network' to deliver secure, ubiquitous, and affordable wireless connectivity.


# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

We will open on November 15th for a one-day presale and are prepared to begin shipping gateways within three weeks of purchase. We will give access to a website for making the purchase with numerous payment options including credit card, crypto and PayPal. Gateways will be shipped on a first paid basis. 
We will offer 2 version of this gateway.
1. Indoor
2. IP weather proof outdoor.

# Drawbacks

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

We are an alternative prepared to offer attractive, secure gateways for immediate purchase.

Not doing this at this time results in the network not expanding thus not enabling the more coverage– this is truly detrimental to the Helium project.

# Unresolved Questions

# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

Current users will have access to purchase more units. If current/new users are seeing the success of Helium they will of course want to grow their own personal grid. 

Current information will remain intact – all that will be needed for the successful launch of these devices will be a way to onboard these units.
